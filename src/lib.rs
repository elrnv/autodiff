/// This crate provides a library for performing efficient automatic differentiation in forward mode.
///
/// # Usage
///
/// `autofloat`can compute derivatives for single and multivariate functions.
/// The library provides a float-like type `AutoFloat` to automatically compute the derivate while the target function is computed.
///
/// First, make sure that the function for which you want to compute a derivate can handle the `AutoFloat` type (either by generics or explicitly).
/// Then simply instantiate the variables for which you want to compute the derivative and pass them into your target function, that's it!
///
/// Here's a simple example, which computes the gradient of a function wrt. two input variables.
/// The function is implemented using generics and can be used with different floating point types.
///
/// ```rust
/// use autofloat::AutoFloat2;
/// use num_traits::float::FloatCore;
///
/// // Define some target function for which we want to compute the derivative.
/// // This variant is generic in T, but you could also use the `AutoFloat` type directly.
/// fn quadratic_func<T>(x: T, y: T) -> T
/// where
///     T: FloatCore,
/// {
///     (x - T::one()) * (T::from(2).unwrap() * y - T::one())
/// }
///
/// fn main() {
///     // Use AutoFloat2 because we use a 2-dimensional function and
///     // we want a 2-dimensional gradient.
///     // The first parameter determines the value of the variable.
///     // The second prameter determines the index of the derivative
///     // for this variable within the gradient vector.
///     let x = AutoFloat2::variable(2.25, 0);
///     let y = AutoFloat2::variable(-1.75, 1);
///
///     let result = quadratic_func(x, y);
///
///     println!(
///         "result={} gradient_x={} gradient_y={}",
///         result.x, result.dx[0], result.dx[1]
///     );
/// }
/// ```
